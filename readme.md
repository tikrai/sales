The CSV file contains the following columns:

3. Determine the number of unique customers who made a purchase.
4. Identify the most popular item (i.e., the item that was purchased the most).
5. Identify the date with the highest total revenue.

The program should output a report that includes the following information:
- Total Revenue: [total revenue]
